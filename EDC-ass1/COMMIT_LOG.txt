Installed relevant .jar files needed to run the tests and followed the JUnit4 guide. I
have some more understanding on how to test my code now. I'll have separate test files 
for each type of tests as there will be multiple components to this program that should 
be tested.

A slight concern I have is that the assignment page states that tests will be compiled 
with 'javac *_Test.java' which does not correspond with the Getting Started guide. I'll 
investigate this later, for now the tests the works.

Just setting up the directory. I've decided to log my progress within this file so it's 
easier to view everything as it will all be in one place.
