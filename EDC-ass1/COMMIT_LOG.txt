I didn't need the try and catch if I throw IOExceptions. I thought I wasn't going to 
worry about validating the input until later, but the requirements are very straight 
forward. I'm also procrastinating starting the hard parts of this assignment.

I suppose validRegex() is something I should test, I'll work on that next.

It is very easy to read input line by line with Java. It is much nicer than coding in C.
The only thing I needed to worry about is wrapping the read line in a try and catch. I 
will need to consider cases of invalid input later on though. For now, I want to 
prioritise writing working code.

Started thinking about the structure of my code and the steps it will need to take. After
getting the regex input, the program should create a corresponding NFA. Then the program
will take more lines of input and simulate the NFA processing that input, printing true 
or false depending on whether the NFA accepts the input.

I'm not too sure how I'll implement NFAs yet so I've decided I'll work on taking in input 
first. I want to be able to continually take in lines of input from the terminal/command
line's standard input (System.in).

Installed relevant .jar files needed to run the tests and followed the JUnit4 guide. I
have some more understanding on how to test my code now. I'll have separate test files 
for each type of tests as there will be multiple components to this program that should 
be tested.

A slight concern I have is that the assignment page states that tests will be compiled 
with 'javac *_Test.java' which does not correspond with the Getting Started guide. I'll 
investigate this later, for now the tests works.

Installed JDK11 and created the RegexEngine source file.

Just setting up the directory. I've decided to log my progress within this file so it's 
easier to view everything as it will all be in one place.
